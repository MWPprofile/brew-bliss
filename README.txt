### Additional Design Choices or Deviations from the Wireframe (with Justification)

Navigation Simplification: The original wireframe included a menu item labeled “Menu,” but this was intentionally removed because there was no dedicated page for it anyway.

Typography Substitution: Fonts were implemented using Google Fonts to approximate the design (e.g., Playfair Display) due to limited access to custom or proprietary fonts.
